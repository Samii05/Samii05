### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Sami Ramzi Rezig (@Samii05)

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science (Data and AI oriented) at the Institute of Communication, UniversitÃ© LumiÃ¨re Lyon 2, after completing four years of studies in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the National Polytechnic School of Algiers

ðŸ“Š I'm passionate about **data** â€” discovering patterns, uncovering trends, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

ðŸ¤– My interests include:
- **Machine Learning** and **model development**
- **Computer Vision** projects
- **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **ETL processes**

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve worked on a web-based **car rental management system**, using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” built from scratch without any framework.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™ve also strengthened my skills through several internships where I worked with:
- **Power BI** for dashboard creation
- **PostgreSQL & SQL Server** for database management
- **ETL development** using tools like SSIS
- **Computer Vision** using yolo model

ðŸ“¬ Feel free to connect or collaborate â€” Iâ€™m always open to learning and building with others!
